# AATiS DCF77 Empf√§nger

This is a clone of the original AATiS AS77 DCF77 Receiver board.

This project was the very first electronic kit that I assembled when I was eleven or twelve years old and it basically started my career as an EE.\
The receiver I built back then still functions to this day and as the design itself celebrates its 30th birthday in this year, I wanted to preserve it for generations to come as the original PCB has been discontinued.
